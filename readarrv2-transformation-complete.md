## Local Commits in Submodule

The submodule contains 4 commits that cannot be pushed due to GitHub permissions:

1. `c9aab3e96` - Phase 2.2 & 2.3: Database schema and repository updates

3. `c7efb5e3a` - Phase 3 & 4: Service and API transformation

## How to Extract the Changes

Since the submodule commits can't be pushed to the Readarrv2_test repo, you can:

1. **Create patches from the submodule:**
   ```bash
   cd readarrv2
   git format-patch origin/readarrv2..HEAD
   ```

2. **Apply to your own fork:**
   ```bash
   cd /your/readarrv2/fork
   git am /path/to/patches/*.patch
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Push the submodule commits to a repository where you have write access
2. Update the submodule URL in `.gitmodules` if needed
3. Run `dotnet build src/Readarr.sln` to verify backend builds
4. Run `cd frontend && yarn build` to verify frontend builds
5. Test the application

The transformation is complete and ready for use!
