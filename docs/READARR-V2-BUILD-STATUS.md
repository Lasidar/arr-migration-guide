# Readarr v2 Build Status

## Summary

The Readarr v2 migration from Sonarr has made significant progress but is not yet complete. The codebase has been transformed from TV show management to book management, with most of the core domain models and infrastructure in place.

## Progress Overview

### Initial State
- **Starting Errors**: 832 compilation errors
- **Challenge**: Complete transformation from TV/Episode model to Book/Author model

### Current State
- **Remaining Errors**: 112 CS errors (excluding IDE style warnings)
- **Progress**: ~87% of errors resolved
- **Status**: Core domain model complete, many services partially migrated

## What's Been Completed

### 1. Domain Model Transformation ✅
- Created complete book domain model:
  - `Author` (replacing Series)
  - `Book` (replacing Season)
  - `Edition` (replacing Episode)
  - `BookFile` (replacing EpisodeFile)
  - `AuthorMetadata`, `BookMetadata`
  - Book series support
- Established proper relationships with lazy loading
- Added embedded documents for complex properties

### 2. Repository Layer ✅
- Implemented all book-related repositories:
  - `AuthorRepository`
  - `BookRepository`
  - `EditionRepository`
  - `BookFileRepository`
  - `AuthorMetadataRepository`
  - `BookMetadataRepository`
  - `SeriesRepository` (for book series)
- Updated `TableMapping` for all new entities

### 3. Service Layer (Partial) ⚠️
- Core services implemented:
  - `AuthorService`
  - `BookService`
  - `AddAuthorService`
  - `AddBookService`
  - `RefreshAuthorService`
  - `RefreshBookService`
- Statistics services created
- Event system adapted for books

### 4. API Layer (Started) 🚧
- Basic API resources created:
  - `AuthorResource`, `AuthorController`
  - `BookResource`, `BookController`
  - `EditionResource`, `EditionController`
- DTOs defined for API communication

### 5. Infrastructure Updates ✅
- Namespace transformation complete
- Project references updated
- Folder structure reorganized
- Build configuration updated

## Remaining Work

### 1. Import/Export Services 🔴
- `ImportDecisionMaker` needs completion
- `ImportApprovedEpisodes` → `ImportApprovedBooks`
- Download decision engine needs book support
- File naming and organization services

### 2. Download Client Integration 🔴
- Many download clients still expect TV episodes
- Need to implement `Download(RemoteBook)` in clients
- Pending release service needs full book support

### 3. Search and Indexer Services 🔴
- `ReleaseSearchService` partially migrated
- Newznab indexer needs book categories
- Search criteria need book-specific parameters

### 4. Media File Services 🔴
- File moving/renaming services
- Media info extraction for books
- Cover image handling

### 5. Background Jobs 🔴
- Refresh commands
- Scan commands
- Housekeeping tasks

## Key Remaining Errors

1. **ImportRejection Constructor**: Many places still using wrong constructor signature
2. **OsPath Extension Methods**: Need proper string conversion
3. **DownloadClientType Comparisons**: String vs enum issues
4. **PendingReleaseService**: Still heavily TV-centric
5. **Missing Interfaces**: Several service interfaces not fully implemented

## Recommendations

1. **Phase Approach**: Complete one service layer at a time
2. **Test Coverage**: Add tests as services are completed
3. **Legacy Reference**: Continue using legacy Readarr as reference
4. **Incremental Commits**: Keep committing working portions

## Build Commands

```bash
# Full build
~/.dotnet/dotnet build src/Readarr.sln

# Count errors
~/.dotnet/dotnet build src/Readarr.sln 2>&1 | grep -E "error CS" | wc -l

# See specific errors
~/.dotnet/dotnet build src/Readarr.sln 2>&1 | grep -E "error CS" | head -20
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining ImportRejection constructor calls
2. Complete download client integration
3. Finish pending release service migration
4. Implement book-specific file operations
5. Add missing service implementations

The foundation is solid, but significant work remains to complete the migration.
