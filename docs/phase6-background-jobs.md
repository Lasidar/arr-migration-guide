# Phase 6: Background Jobs & Tasks

## Overview
Phase 6 implements the background job system for Readarr, including scheduled tasks, refresh operations, library scanning, and housekeeping. These jobs ensure the library stays up-to-date and the system runs smoothly.

## Tasks

### Task 6.1: Create Background Jobs Documentation
- Document job scheduling system
- Define task priorities
- Establish execution patterns

### Task 6.2: Implement Author Refresh Task
- Metadata refresh from external sources
- Update author information
- Check for new books
- Handle author renames

### Task 6.3: Implement Book Refresh Task
- Update book metadata
- Check for new editions
- Refresh release dates
- Update ratings and reviews

### Task 6.4: Create Library Scan Service
- Scan author folders for new files
- Detect missing files
- Import unmapped files
- Clean up orphaned records

### Task 6.5: Implement RSS Sync
- Check indexers for new releases
- Process release decisions
- Queue downloads automatically
- Handle RSS interval settings

### Task 6.6: Create Housekeeping Tasks
- Clean up old logs
- Remove orphaned files
- Update file permissions
- Database maintenance

### Task 6.7: Implement Backup Service
- Scheduled database backups
- Configuration backups
- Retention policies
- Restore functionality

### Task 6.8: Commit Phase 6 Changes
- Test all background jobs
- Verify scheduling works
- Documentation updates
- Git commit and push

## Job Types

### Scheduled Jobs
Jobs that run on a fixed schedule:
- RSS Sync (5-60 minutes)
- Library Scan (12-24 hours)
- Backup (daily/weekly)
- Housekeeping (daily)

### Event-Triggered Jobs
Jobs triggered by specific events:
- Author Added → Refresh Author
- Book Added → Refresh Book
- Download Complete → Import & Scan
- Author Renamed → Update Paths

### Manual Jobs
Jobs that can be triggered by users:
- Refresh All Authors
- Rescan Library
- Search Missing Books
- Clear Logs

## Command Pattern

All jobs follow the command pattern:

```csharp
public class RefreshAuthorCommand : Command
{
    public int? AuthorId { get; set; }
    public bool ForceRefresh { get; set; }
}

public class RefreshAuthorService : IExecute<RefreshAuthorCommand>
{
    public void Execute(RefreshAuthorCommand command)
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

## Task Scheduling

### Priority Levels
1. **Critical** - Import, Download handling
2. **High** - Refresh operations
3. **Normal** - Library scans, RSS sync
4. **Low** - Housekeeping, maintenance

### Execution Rules
- One refresh operation at a time
- Imports take precedence
- RSS sync respects rate limits
- Housekeeping runs during idle time

## Progress Tracking

### Progress Reporting
```csharp
public interface IProgressReporter
{
    void Report(int current, int total, string message);
    void ReportStatus(string status);
    void Complete();
}
```

### Job Status
- Queued
- Executing
- Completed
- Failed
- Cancelled

## Error Handling

### Retry Logic
- Network failures: 3 retries with backoff
- File system errors: 1 retry
- Database errors: No retry
- External API errors: Respect rate limits

### Failure Actions
- Log detailed error
- Send notification (if configured)
- Mark job as failed
- Schedule retry (if applicable)

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Management
- Limit concurrent jobs
- Throttle I/O operations
- Batch database updates
- Memory-efficient file scanning

### Optimization
- Skip unchanged authors/books
- Incremental scanning
- Parallel processing where safe
- Caching of external API results

## Monitoring

### Health Checks
- Last execution time
- Success/failure rate
- Average duration
- Queue depth

### Alerts
- Job failures
- Long-running jobs
- Queue backlog
- Resource exhaustion
