# Migration Analysis Plan: Sonarr → Lidarr → Readarr

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to analyze and document the architectural migrations from Sonarr (TV show management) to Lidarr (music management) to Readarr (book management). The goal is to create documentation detailed enough that a senior engineer could recreate Readarr from scratch if both Readarr and Lidarr were lost.

## Project Background

- **Sonarr**: Original project - TV show/season/episode management system
- **Lidarr**: Fork of Sonarr at commit `83370dd` - adapted for music/album/song management
- **Readarr**: Fork of Lidarr at commit `47f4441` - adapted for book/author management

## Analysis Objectives

1. **Identify Core Architectural Changes**: Document fundamental shifts in data models, storage patterns, and system architecture
2. **Map Domain Model Transformations**: Understand how TV → Music → Book domain concepts were mapped
3. **Document Integration Changes**: Catalog changes to external service integrations (metadata providers, download clients, etc.)
4. **Extract Migration Patterns**: Identify reusable patterns that could guide future media type adaptations
5. **Create Reconstruction Guide**: Produce documentation sufficient for recreating Readarr from Sonarr

- [ ] Identify media-specific UI elements

## Phase 6: Testing Strategy Analysis (Days 15-16)

### 6.1 Test Coverage Comparison
- [ ] Compare unit test coverage
- [ ] Analyze integration test patterns

## Phase 8: Documentation Creation (Days 19-21)

### 8.1 Migration Pattern Catalog
Create a comprehensive catalog including:
- Domain model transformation patterns
- Integration adapter patterns
- UI component migration patterns
- Configuration migration patterns

### 8.2 Reconstruction Guide
Develop step-by-step guide covering:
- Initial fork preparation
- Domain model transformation
- Integration replacements
- UI adaptations
- Testing strategy
- Deployment considerations

### 8.3 Reference Architecture
Create architectural diagrams showing:
- Component relationships
- Data flow patterns

## Deliverables

1. **Migration Pattern Catalog** (`docs/migration-patterns.md`)
   - Reusable patterns for media type adaptation
   - Code examples and templates
   - Decision trees for common scenarios

2. **Reconstruction Guide** (`docs/reconstruction-guide.md`)
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Checkpoint validations
   - Troubleshooting guide

3. **Architecture Comparison** (`docs/architecture-comparison.md`)
   - Side-by-side architectural views
   - Component mapping tables
   - Technology stack evolution

4. **Integration Mapping** (`docs/integration-mapping.md`)
   - External service integration guide
   - API mapping documentation
   - Protocol adaptation patterns

5. **Domain Model Evolution** (`docs/domain-model-evolution.md`)
   - Entity relationship diagrams
   - Database schema comparisons
   - Business rule transformations

## Success Criteria

The analysis will be considered successful when:

1. A senior engineer can understand the complete transformation path from Sonarr to Readarr
2. The documentation provides sufficient detail to recreate Readarr starting from Sonarr
3. Reusable patterns are identified that could guide future media type adaptations
4. All major architectural decisions and trade-offs are documented
5. The guide includes validation checkpoints to ensure accurate recreation

## Risk Mitigation

- **Large Codebase**: Focus on architectural patterns over implementation details
- **Missing Context**: Interview original developers if possible, document assumptions
- **Rapid Evolution**: Focus on stable architectural patterns rather than latest features
- **Complex Integrations**: Prioritize documenting integration interfaces over implementation

## Timeline

- **Total Duration**: 21 working days
- **Weekly Reviews**: End of each week
- **Final Review**: Day 22-23
- **Documentation Polish**: Day 24-25

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Set up development environments
3. Begin Phase 1 analysis
4. Schedule weekly review meetings
5. Identify any additional stakeholders or resources needed
