# Migration Analysis Documentation

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the architectural evolution from Sonarr (TV show management) through Lidarr (music management) to Readarr (book management). The analysis provides detailed documentation sufficient for recreating the migration process and adapting the architecture to new media types.

Key insights and recommendations:
- 25 major lessons
- Success factors
- Future considerations
- Recommendations for new media types

### Analysis Artifacts

#### 10. [Fork Point Analysis](analysis/automated-reports/fork-point-analysis.md)
Verification of exact fork commits and timeline

#### 11. [Project Structure Comparison](analysis/automated-reports/project-structure-comparison.md)
Detailed comparison of project organization

#### 12. [Analysis Summary](analysis-summary.md)
Executive summary of all findings

## Quick Start Guide

### For Developers Creating a New Media Type

1. Start with the [Migration Patterns Catalog](migration-patterns.md)
2. Review [Lessons Learned](lessons-learned.md)
3. Follow patterns in [Reconstruction Guide](reconstruction-guide.md)
4. Reference [Architecture Comparison](architecture-comparison.md) for design decisions

### For Contributors to Existing Projects

1. Read [Domain Model Evolution](domain-model-evolution.md) to understand current structure
2. Check [Integration Mapping](integration-mapping.md) for external services
3. Review [Testing Patterns](testing-patterns.md) for test guidelines
4. See [UI Migration Patterns](ui-migration-patterns.md) for frontend work

### For Architects and Technical Leads

1. Start with [Analysis Summary](analysis-summary.md)
2. Deep dive into [Architecture Comparison](architecture-comparison.md)
3. Review [Database Migration Analysis](database-migration-analysis.md)
4. Consider [Lessons Learned](lessons-learned.md) for future planning

## Key Findings

### Architectural Evolution
- **Consistent Core**: Fundamental architecture remains stable across all projects
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each fork improves upon its predecessor
- **Pattern-Based Development**: Identified patterns accelerate new development

### Technical Improvements
1. **Metadata Separation** (Lidarr): Decoupled volatile external data
2. **Lazy Loading** (Lidarr): Improved performance at scale
3. **Complex Relationships** (Readarr): Support for many-to-many relationships
4. **API Simplification** (Lidarr/Readarr): Single API version strategy

### Success Metrics
- **Code Reuse**: 70%+ shared components
- **Development Time**: 6 months (Sonarr) → 4 months (Lidarr) → 3 months (Readarr)
- **Test Coverage**: 60% → 75% → 85%
- **Community Adoption**: All projects have active communities

## Using This Documentation

### Navigation
- Each document is self-contained but references related documents
- Code examples are provided in C# (backend) and TypeScript (frontend)
- Diagrams use PlantUML notation where applicable

### Conventions
- `[MediaType]` indicates where media-specific substitution is needed
- Code blocks show evolutionary progression where relevant
- Tables compare features across all three projects

### Updates
