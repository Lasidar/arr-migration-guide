# Phase 3: Service Layer Transformation

## Overview
Phase 3 focuses on implementing the service layer that provides business logic for the book domain. This includes author management, book management, metadata services, and supporting services.

## Tasks

### Task 3.1: Implement AuthorService
- Full implementation of IAuthorService
- Author CRUD operations
- Path validation and management
- Event publishing for author changes
- Integration with metadata service

### Task 3.2: Implement BookService  
- Full implementation of IBookService
- Book CRUD operations
- Monitoring management
- Series relationships
- Event publishing for book changes

### Task 3.3: Implement EditionService
- Full implementation of IEditionService
- Edition management per book
- File associations
- Monitoring controls

### Task 3.4: Implement SeriesService (Book Series)
- Full implementation of ISeriesService
- Book series management
- Book-to-series linking
- Series metadata handling

### Task 3.5: Implement Metadata Services
- AuthorMetadataService
- BookMetadataService
- Metadata refresh logic
- External ID management

### Task 3.6: Implement Refresh Services
- RefreshAuthorService
- RefreshBookService
- Metadata updates from external sources
- Cover image management

### Task 3.7: Implement Statistics Services
- AuthorStatisticsService
- BookStatisticsService
- File counts and sizes
- Missing/monitored calculations

### Task 3.8: Commit Phase 3 Changes
- Final testing
- Documentation updates
- Git commit and push

## Service Patterns

### Repository Pattern
All services interact with repositories for data access:
```csharp
public class AuthorService : IAuthorService
{
    private readonly IAuthorRepository _authorRepository;
    private readonly IEventAggregator _eventAggregator;
    // ...
}
```

### Event Publishing
Services publish domain events for changes:
```csharp
_eventAggregator.PublishEvent(new AuthorAddedEvent(author));
```

### Validation
Services validate business rules before operations:
```csharp
if (_authorRepository.AuthorPathExists(author.Path))
{
    throw new InvalidOperationException("Author path already exists");
}
```

## Dependencies
- Domain models from Phase 1
- Repositories from Phase 1
- API contracts from Phase 2
- Event system
- Validation framework
