# Readarr v2 Build Success Summary

## Build Status: âœ… SUCCESS

The Readarr v2 migration has been successfully completed to the point where the solution builds without compilation errors.

### Build Statistics
- **CS Errors**: 0 (no compilation errors)
- **IDE Warnings**: 64 (mostly unnecessary using directives)
- **Other Warnings**: 265 (various code quality warnings)

### Key Achievements

1. **Namespace Migration**: Successfully transformed all Sonarr/NzbDrone namespaces to Readarr
2. **Domain Model Migration**: Created new book-centric domain models:
   - Author (replacing Series)
   - Book (replacing Season)
   - Edition (replacing Episode)
   - BookFile (replacing EpisodeFile)
   - Book Series (for book collections)

3. **Mixed Codebase Support**: The codebase now supports both TV and Book content:
   - TV-specific code remains functional for backward compatibility
   - Book-specific code has been added alongside
   - Shared interfaces and services handle both content types

4. **Database Schema**: Updated TableMapping to support new entities while preserving legacy TV tables

5. **API Structure**: Created v1 API endpoints for:
   - Authors
   - Books
   - Editions
   - Book Files
   - Book Series

### Known Issues and TODOs

1. **TV-Specific Code**: Some TV parsing and processing code needs proper book equivalents
2. **Test Coverage**: Unit tests need to be updated for the new domain models
3. **UI Integration**: Frontend changes are not included in this backend migration
4. **Database Migrations**: Currently treating DB as fresh (no migration from legacy)
5. **Metadata Providers**: Book metadata providers need full implementation

### Next Steps

1. Run the application and fix any runtime errors
2. Update unit tests to work with new domain models
3. Implement book-specific business logic where TV logic remains
4. Create database migration scripts for existing Readarr installations
5. Update the frontend to work with the new API endpoints

### Build Command
```bash
cd /workspace
~/.dotnet/dotnet build src/Readarr.sln
```

The solution builds successfully with .NET 8.0 SDK.
