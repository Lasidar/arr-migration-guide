# The "Big Picture" Narrative

## Purpose and Problem Statement

Readarr is an ebook and audiobook collection manager designed for users who obtain their digital books through Usenet and BitTorrent. The system aims to solve several key problems in digital book collection management:

- Manual tracking of new releases from favorite authors is time-consuming
- Organizing digital book collections with consistent naming schemas is labor-intensive
- Managing book quality (upgrading from lower quality formats to higher quality ones) is difficult
- Integrating with various download clients and maintaining a library requires significant manual effort

Readarr addresses these problems through automation, monitoring, and integration with existing systems.

## Primary Functionality

Readarr provides the following core functionality:

- Automated monitoring of RSS feeds for new books from configured authors
- Automatic downloading of missing books in a user's collection
- Intelligent handling of book quality, with automatic upgrading when better versions become available
- Consistent naming and organization of digital book files
- Integration with download clients (SABnzbd, NZBGet, QBittorrent, etc.)
- Integration with Calibre for enhanced library management and format conversion
- Book metadata retrieval and management
- Comprehensive search capabilities for finding specific books or authors
- Failed download handling with automatic retry logic

## Intended Users

The system is designed for:

- Digital book collectors who use Usenet or BitTorrent services
- Users wanting to automate their digital book acquisition and organization
- Users with large ebook and/or audiobook collections requiring management
- Users who prefer to access their books through self-hosted libraries rather than commercial platforms

## Technology Stack Rationale

### Backend (.NET Core)

Readarr's backend is built on .NET, providing:
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)
- Strong type safety and performance benefits
- Extensive library ecosystem
- Shared codebase with other "arr" family applications (Sonarr, Radarr, etc.)

### Frontend (React/Redux)

The frontend utilizes React with Redux for state management:
- Component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability
- Efficient rendering through virtual DOM
- Centralized state management with Redux for predictable data flow
- Rich ecosystem of libraries and tools
- Modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface

This technology stack enables Readarr to function effectively across multiple platforms while providing a robust, feature-rich application for managing digital book collections.
